I need you to:
- program a Minecraft multiplayer mode,
- program tools for map creation, and
- set the server up with some intuitive plugins

256x256 map full of dirt, expect for player spawning areas. Each player have their own color-coded corners: red, blue, green, and yellow.

When you kill another player, a block of wool corresponding to your color will be spawn to the opposite site of the player you've just killed. Each corner can contain only one block of wool at a time and the block can only be interacted by the player of corresponding color. The first to get ten points wins.

If a player you've attacked dies within 30 seconds after receiving damage from you and nobody else, you're rewarded.
